In production environments, RisingWave is widely used for real-time reporting. You can utilize a variety of reporting tools, such as [Apache Superset](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/superset-integration/), [Grafana](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/grafana-integration/), etc., to interface with RisingWave.

If the reporting tool you are using is not listed in the official RisingWave documentation, you can also attempt to connect to RisingWave directly using the PostgreSQL interface. Because RisingWave is compatible with the PostgreSQL wire protocol, most systems within the PostgreSQL ecosystem are likely able to communicate with RisingWave directly.
